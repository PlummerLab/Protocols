  abstract: "High yields of conidia of Venturia inaequalis were produced from either
    mycelial fragments or conidia on cellophane-covered surfaces of agar media incubated
    under continuous near-ultraviolet light. Optimal conditions required a cellophane-covered
    surface of potato-dextrose agar in combination with light and incubation for 1
    wk. The procedure represents a convenient techique for the mass-production of
    clonal and sterile *V. inaequalis* conidia. Conidia were biolistically transformed
    to hygromycin B resistance with a plasmid (pOHT) containing a bacterial phosphotransferase
    gene spliced between regulatory elements from *Aspergillus nidulans*. Southern
    hybridization analysis showed that the plasmid was incorporated into heterologous
    regions of the genome. Hygromycin B–resistant transformants were mitotically
    stable during nonselective propagation. The heterologous gene conferring hygromycin
    B resistance was expressed during early stages of conidia germination and during
    vegetative growth of mycelium."

  abstract: The molecular basis for the gene-for-gene relationship of V m -resistance
    in apple to Venturia inaequalis was investigated. Incompatible reactions involved
    a hypersensitive response (HR), which was accompanied by the accumulation of dark
    brown pigments and autofluorescent materials in epidermal and mesophyll cells
    at the site of invasion. Cell-free culture filtrates of the avirulent isolate
    elicited an HR in the Vm host (h 5 ) leaves, but not in the susceptible host (h
    1 ). The elicitor activity was resistant to boiling but was abolished by proteinase
    K digestion. Elicitation of HR was used to monitor purification of the avirulence
    factor, AVRVm, from liquid cultures of the avirulent isolate following ultrafiltration,
    acetone precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The purest fraction contained
    three major proteins all with low isoelectric points (pI 3.0-4.5). The fraction
    also elicited HR on the differential host h 4 , but not on other resistant hosts
    (h 2 , h 3 and h 6 ) tested. Three candidate AVRVm proteins were identified and
    amino acid sequences were obtained using Edman degradation and mass spectrometry.
    Nucleotide sequences corresponding to these proteins were found in databases of
    V. inaequalis expressed sequence tags. There were no polymorphisms evident between
    avirulent and virulent isolates (representing races 1 and 5 respectively) either
    at genomic DNA or cDNA level of the full open reading frames. RT-PCR revealed
    that all genes were expressed in both avirulent and virulent isolates during in
    vitro and in planta growth. All three genes showed similar levels of expression
    between avirulent and virulent isolates during their in vitro growth. However,
    two of these genes were expressed at lower levels in the virulent compared with
    the avirulent isolate during compatible infection. Implications of this difference
    in expression and the future experiments to identify the genuine AvrVm gene were
    discussed.

# Media preparation

1. Cut cellophane into disks approximately the diameter of the petri dish that you are using.
1. Soak cellophane pieces in ultrapure H~2~O (E.G. MilliQ, reverse osmosis etc.) for 12~hrs.
1. Sandwich the cellophane between two pieces of filter paper (E.G. Whatman qualitative) and place in a glass petri dish.
1. Fill the petri dish with ultrapure H~2~O and wrap with aluminium foil.
1. Autoclave the membranes for ≥ 15\ min at 120°C.
1. Prepare potato dextrose agar plates as per manufacturers instructions (usually 39\ g·L^-1^).
1. In a sterile environment lay a single piece of cellulose membrane onto the agar, avoiding air bubbles.
1. \[Optional\] Lighty score the cellophane membrane to encourage intracellulosic growth (Pers. Comm. K. Plummer).


# Fungal preparation

1. Cut mycellium from existing _Venturia_ cultures and blend in sterile ultrapure water (approx. 0.5 cm^2^·mL^-1^).
   Blend in short bursts to prevent temperature changes in water and improve blending efficiency.
1. Aliquot 200-750\ μL of blended mycelium onto the cellophane covered surface and spread the liquid evenly by tilting.
1. Seal with parafilm.
1. Incubate for 1-4 weeks with the following conditions:
 - 20°C
 - RH?
 - Continuous light. 25\ cm from \(near infrared\) GE black light 15\ W, 390\ nm (emission max) of 8.3\ μW·cm^-2^.


# Conidial separation

1. Remove cellophane from agar surface and place in a 150\ mL beaker containing 50\ mL sterile H~2~O.
1. Stir beaker slowly for about 5\ min to remove the conidia from the cellophane.
   - Up to 10 cellophane membranes can be washed individually in the same 50\ mL water to increase the final concentration of conidia. 
1. Pour the conidial suspension through something to remove the residual mycellium.
 - @Parker1995 filters through a syringe containing glass wool.
 - Others use miracloth. Layers? Exclusion size?
1. Centrifuge the suspension for 10 min at 3000\ rcf @ RT.
1. Discard the supernatant.
1. Resuspend in a minimal amount of sterile ultrapure H~2~O.
1. Determine the number of conidia present using an haemocytometer.
   Do this 2 or 3 with random sampling from the haemocytometer grid.
1. Test the germination rate by dropping ~ 20\ μL of the suspension onto 3 plates containing 4% water agar.
   Count the number of germinated vs ungerminated conidia after 24\ hrs.
   Divide the number of germinated spores by the total number of spores to get the % germination.
   You can expect this number to be somewhere between 50% and 80% in normal cultures.
1. Dilute the suspension to a useable conidial concentration.
 - @Win2003 used 3×10^4^\ conidia·mL^-1^.
 - Others suggest using 10^5^\ conidia·mL^-1^.
