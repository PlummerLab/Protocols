  abstract: Apple scab is caused by the fungal phytopathogen _Venturia inaequalis_.
    Naturally occurring resistance to _V. inaequalis_ has been observed in wild apple
    species and is attributed to the presence of major resistance (_R_) genes. These
    genes are inherited in a simple 1:1 ratio in progeny of a cross between resistant
    and susceptible plants. Incorporation of _R_ genes into popular cultivars through
    breeding or transformation would provide protection from scab, however multiple
    _R_ genes must be identified and integrated to confer durable resistance. Two _R_
    genes, _Vh4_ and _Vm_ condition resistance through a macroscopically identical resistance
    response. These _R_ genes can be differentiated using molecular markers, but they
    currently have limited effectiveness in identifying _Vh4_ and _Vm_ due to poor linkage.
    Other methods of identifying these _R_ genes would be useful and phenotyping with
    the aid of fluorescence microscopy was investigated in an attempt to identify
    _R_ gene specific characters. Pathogenicity testing and fluorescence microscopy
    revealed that two different _Vm_ containing hosts, deriving _Vm_ from two distinct
    wild species (_Malus atrosanguinea_ and _M. micromalus_), shared an identical fluorescence
    response in the resistant phenotype. A different resistance response was seen
    in a _Vh4_ containing host, which derives _Vh4_ from _M. pumila_. The type of cells
    involved and the extent of the fluorescent reaction zone on the leaves, allowed
    distinction between _Vh4 and Vm_ containing hosts. _Vh4 and Vm_ resistant progeny
    demonstrated inheritance of the specific resistance phenotype associated with
    their respective parents. Some variation of the responses was seen, but the phenotype
    allowed differentiation between _Vh4_ and _Vm_ containing progeny. Specific _R_ gene
    presence was verified using molecular markers. The more closely linked _Vh4_ marker
    was present in all the hosts thought to contain _Vh4_, whereas the _Vm_-linked marker
    was inherited as predicted in most but not all progeny. This study highlights
    the use of fluorescence microscopy as an informative technique, providing novel
    phenotypic characters that may be useful in disease resistance breeding.

Originally described and validated in @Nicholson1972 this protocol is based on @Conolly2002.

1. Prepare sterile plates containing water agar (1.2%) or dH~2~O soaked filter paper (eg whatman \#1).
1. Take young unfurled leaf, 3^rd^ to 6^th^ from the apical meristem.
   Place in water with petiole submerged immediately after cutting.
1. Gently rub leaf to remove leaf hairs and debris.
1. Rinse under running clean water for 15 minutes.
1. Cut the petiole closer to the leaf base at an angle to allow maximum vascular contact with water in a petri dish.
1. Rinse leaves 3 times with sterile water.
1. Place leaf adaxial side up in the petri dish ensuring contact of the cut petiole with water or agar.
1. Leave the petri dish with leaf in a laminar flow hood until th eupper surface of the leaf has dried.
1. Drop conidial suspension (20-50\ μL) to one side of the surface of the dried leaf.
   Also add sterile water to the other side of the leaf surface to act as a control.
1. Seal the dishes with Parafilm 'M'.
1. Store under bright fluorescent light with 16\ hr light at 20°C.

Response should appear after 8 days.
