# Pathogenicity testing of _Venturia inaequalis_ by detached leaf assay.

Detached leaf assay [@Nicholson1972].


1. Prepare sterile plates containing water agar (1.2%) or RO H~2~0 soaked filter paper (eg whatman \#1).
1. Take young unfurled leaf, 3^rd^ to 6^th^ from the apical meristem.
   Place in water with petiole submerged immediately after cutting.
1. Gently rub leaf to remove leaf hairs and debris.
1. Rinse under running clean water for 15 minutes.
1. Cut the petiole closer to the leaf base at an angle to allow maximum vascular contact with water in a petri dish.
1. Rinse leaves 3 times with sterile water.
1. Place leaf adaxial side up in the petri dish ensuring contact of the cut petiole with water/agar.
1. Leave the petri dish with leaf in a laminar flow hood until th eupper surface of the leaf has dried.
1. Drop conidial suspension (20-50 $\mu$L) to one side of the surface of the dried leaf.
   Also add sterile water to the other side of the leaf surface to act as a control.
1. Seal the dishes with Parafilm 'M'.
1. Store under bright fluorescent light with 16 hr light at 20^$\circ$^C

Response should appear after 8 days.
