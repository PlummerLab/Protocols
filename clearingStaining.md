Based on the clearing and staining procedure described in @Bruzzese1983.


# Clearing-staining solution (Makes approx. 1\ L)

- 300\ mL ethanol (95%)
- 150\ mL chloroform
- 125\ mL lactic acid 125\ mL
- 150\ g phenol
- 450\ g chloral hydrate
- 0.6\ g aniline blue 


# Stockwell's bleach

This solution had been published in the 1940's and 1970's.
@Morawetz2013 is the clearest recipe available online.

- 10\ mL 10% chromic acid (or 1\ g powdered with dH~2~O)
- 10\ mL glacial acetic acid
- 1\ g potassium dichromate
- 80\ mL dH~2~O


# Clearing and staining

1. Cut the leaves into 1-3\ cm^2^ pieces.
1. Immerse the leaves in the clearing staining solution (2\ mL·cm^2^) in stoppered glass vial.
1. Leave for 48\ hrs at RT (approx. 25°C).
1. Remove the leaf pieces and place in chloral hydrate (2.5\ g·mL^-1^ in water).
1. Leave for 12-24\ hrs at RT.
1. Remove the piece and rinse with distilled water.

If after chloral hydrate treatment the leaves are not completely cleared, soak in Stockwell's bleach and repeat the clearing and staining procedure.
Mount the stained leaf pieces in/on a permanent mounting medium.
